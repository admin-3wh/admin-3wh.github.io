    <h1>Triager+: From Concept to Execution</h1>
    <p class="meta">Written by 3wh Admin · Published on <span id="pub-date">Jul 26, 2025</span></p>

    <p><em>Triager+</em> began as a challenge — to combine machine learning with a usable, focused web interface for classifying help desk tickets. But it evolved into something more: an exercise in product minimalism, memory-aware architecture, and end-to-end delivery from backend to UI. This is the story of its construction.</p>

    <h2>What Is Triager+?</h2>
    <p>Triager+ is a browser-based tool that accepts unstructured help desk ticket descriptions and classifies them into predefined <strong>categories</strong> and <strong>priorities</strong>. It supports two models: a lightweight Naive Bayes and a (currently disabled) DistilBERT deep learning alternative.</p>

    <h2>Why Build It?</h2>
    <p>The goal was to create something useful but deployable, intelligent but minimal. No extra packages, no large dependencies if avoidable. It was also a technical portfolio project — to show you can build something <strong>real</strong>, not just theoretical.</p>

    <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
    <p>The system is composed of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A FastAPI backend that handles requests, preprocessing, and model inference</li>
      <li>scikit-learn for training and saving the Naive Bayes models</li>
      <li>A client-side interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
      <li>Hosted via Render (backend) and GitHub Pages (frontend)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Training the Models</h2>
    <p>The Naive Bayes model was trained on labeled ticket data using TF-IDF vectorization. It predicts both category and priority. DistilBERT was finetuned but disabled due to RAM constraints on free Render plans.</p>

    <h2>Handling Constraints</h2>
    <p>The project faced real-world constraints:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CORS errors</strong> requiring careful middleware setup</li>
      <li><strong>Memory limits</strong> leading to the decision to gracefully disable the transformer model</li>
      <li><strong>Latency optimization</strong> for fast response on low-cost infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Designing the UI</h2>
    <p>UI design was kept intentionally minimal. Buttons, confidence percentages, a clear reset option, and basic mobile responsiveness were all tuned by hand. An optional analytics system (Google Analytics) was added with future usage tracking in mind.</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Small projects still require deployment discipline</li>
      <li>Frontend error handling needs to anticipate every backend fail mode</li>
      <li>Tools that say little but do something useful will always have value</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
    <p>Triager+ is complete — but the methodology behind it (quick experiments, direct feedback, real-world context) will drive future work. A second project is already in motion: <strong>ShapeSound</strong>.</p>
